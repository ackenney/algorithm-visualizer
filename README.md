# Algorithm Visualizer
This project is an algorithm visualizer application made with Python and Pygame that shows the sorting processes for the bubble sort, selection sort, shell sort, and insertion sort algorithms 


## Implemented Algorithms
- Bubble sort
- Insertion sort
- Selection sort
- Shell sort

## Demos


## Time Complexity
| Sorting Algorithm | Average Time Complexity | Worst Case Time Complexity |
| ----------------- | ---------------------- | ---------------------------| 
| Bubble Sort       | O(N^2)                 | O(N^2)                     | 
| Insertion Sort    | O(N^2)                 | O(N^2)                     | 
| Selection Sort    | O(N^2)                 | O(n^2)                     | 
| Shell Sort        | O(N^5/4)               | O(N^2)                     |
